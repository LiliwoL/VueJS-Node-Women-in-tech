<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious. As with many other guys, I’m increasingly struggling with the most positive way I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology, and as I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, and work to understand the history of women in the space.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving things forward. My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented in my research.</p> 

<p>To kick things off, I wanted to showcase notable women in the history of compute, and by spending my day looking beyond just the Wikipedia, I was hoping to compile an update to date list of women who have made a significant impact on technology, and as I do with all of my work I wanted to help introduce people to APIs along the way.</p>

<p>I spent Ada Lovelace Day researching some of the notable women in the history of technology, through to today. The list is complete, but it is more complete than any one list I can find out there, and the big difference is my list is machine readable. You can pull the JSON listing of notable women and use in any other website, or mobile application.</p> 

<p>Next I want to make an actual API so you can search the lists, as well as the ability to add, and update the list via the API. I want to also take advantage of the fact the the website is build on Github, and encourage visitors to help me make the list as complete, and extend the reach of the information available here.</p>

<p>If you know someone or something that should be represented here, feel free to reach out via the Github issues, Twitter, or feel free to fork the project and contribute any way you see fit. Use the roadmap page to find out what I’m working on, and planning to take my research next.</p>
