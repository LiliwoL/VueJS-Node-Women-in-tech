<h3>Women in Technology</h3>
<p>This is a list of women who have made significant contributions to the world of compute and resulting Internet. This listing is driven by a machine readable listing I have compiled over the years, but if there is someone you feel should be on this list you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech/issues/new">submit your suggestions via the Github issue management for the site</a>, or if you are feeling brave you can <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/women-in-tech">fork the project by editing the people.yaml file located in the _data folder</a>, and submit a pull request when ready, and I'll include in the public website.</p>
<table width="100%">

<p>Welcome to my Ada Lovelace Day project--building a machine readable list of the notable women in the history of compute. As I do with all of my work, I also want to introduce people to the world of APIs along the way, so building an API to help educate people about women in the history of compute was a great way to spend my day, and bring attention to this topic.</p>
<p>I spent the day each year researching the history of women in tech, and <a href="https://women-in-tech.apievangelist.com/apis/people/">compiled all of my research into a single machine readable JSON file</a>, that anyone can use. With this research available in a machine readable format, anyone can potentially syndicate the information available here on any website or mobile application, extending this important layer of our history to a wider audience.</p>
